            <p>These are sketches of Ayaka, Venti, and Ayato. Characters from Genshin Impact.
                I began sketching these because they are some of the favourite characters
                of me and my friends.

            <p>This is actually a  character sketch I designed for the animation competition that me and
                my classmates joined. He was supposed to be a overworked, sleep-deprived office worker.
                But it was eventually changed as the animaton genre plan changed.
